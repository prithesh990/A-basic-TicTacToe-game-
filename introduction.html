<div style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8)"><h3>Step 1</h3>
<br>Have the first player go first as the first player goes with "X", you can allow the first player to decide whether he wants to go with "X"s or "O"s. These symbols will be placed on the table, in the attempt to have three of them in a row.  This will maximize your chances of winning, since you'll be able to create a row of three "X"s or "O"s.<br><br>
</div>
<div style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8)"><h3>Step 2</h3>
<br>
Have the second player go second. After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be different from the symbol of the first player. The second player can either try to block the first player from creating a row of three, or focus on creating his or her own row of three. Ideally, the player can do both.<br><br>
</div>
<div style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8)"><h3>Step 3</h3>
<br>
Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn a row of three symbols or until no one can win. The first player to draw three of his or her symbols in a row, whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, has won tic-tac-toe. However, if both players are playing with optimal strategy.<br><br>
